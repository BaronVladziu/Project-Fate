## Project Fate

This is simple RTS colony management game. Or will be. For now it's just an idea.

# Requirements
To run this game you'll need OpenGL installed. On linux you can do this using my script:
```shell
./deps/install-openGL.sh
```
Hopefully this will do the trick. (Of course you need `sudo` for it.)

On windows I don't know how to install it yet.

# Installation
To install and run the game use:
```shell
./build.sh
```

If you have the game installed already, use:
```shell
./run.sh
```
